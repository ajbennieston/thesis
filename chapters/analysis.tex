\chapter{Analysis of Neutrino Interactions in a Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chamber}\label{chapter:Analysis}
\section{Introduction}
The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate a fully automated reconstruction chain for event data from \ac{LAr TPC}s. Since the details of charge readout and position reconstruction will vary depending on the detector technology and geometry, as well as the equipment used, this study begins from the point at which three-dimensional hit data exists in a persistent on-disk format. This chapter uses the algorithms and techniques presented earlier to attempt to reconstruct physics information such as the muon energy from charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions at beam energies of $770\MeV$ and $4.5\GeV$.

\section{Charged Current $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \mu + p$ at $770\MeV$}
A sample of $1000$ events produced from charged current interactions of $\nu_\mu$ at $770\MeV$, yielding $\mu + p$ (only) final states were considered. These are the same events used for validation of algorithms earlier in this thesis. Of these 1000 events,
